# What is this repository about?
I am going to share some small scripts I use in my daily life.

# What can be found in this repository?
BASHRC: a function to check a text file for duplicates and clean them. a function to create a folder and get into it. a function to get into the last edited folder inside a folder.
                                                                                                                                                              
VIMRC: nothing recommended. just my personal settings.
                                                                                                                                                        
GIOXpy: a script that can download the currently opened YouTube page as mp3/mp4. script also works with a given YouTube link.
                                                                                                                                                                  
bgchanger: this script changes the wallpaper when we enter a new period of day -day/night-
                                                                                                                                                            
syntaxchecker: this script can be used to check a word to see if we wrote it correct or not. (This code belongs to Peter Norvig. I just added some lines of code to make it usable in daily life. I don't own anything about this code.)
                                                                                                                                                                                  
pytranslator: this script translates what you copied after you pressed "`" key. currently it translates to Turkish language but it can be changed by changing tr to [some other lang code] in translator.py. it sends a notification using Gnome's notify-send tool.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
# Anything to do before using?
You need to change the profile path in giox.py to use giox                                                                          
You need to change the paths in the variable section in bgchanger to use bgchanger
