# What is this repository about?
I am going to share some small scripts I use in my daily life. Scripts like giox[0] or bgchanger[1].

# Anything to do before using?
You need to change the profile path in giox.py to use giox                                                                          
You need to change the paths in the variable section in bgchanger to use bgchanger
